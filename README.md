## Crisp
Crisp is a chip8 interpreter implemented from scratch in C89.

### Why ?
I recently wrote an almost complete 8086 emulator in C from scratch and while it was a fun project, I noticed that I have much to learn when it comes to writing emulators. According to multiple sources on the internet, it looks like the chip8 interpreter is a good place to start learning emulator development as it isn't a real (hardware implementation) system, but rather an interpreter which makes it relatively easier to write code for.

My goal is to learn more about emulators and how they work from doing this project. Hopefully with this knowlegde, I can fix the design issues that my [8086 emulator](https://github.com/aelobdog/cuppu86) has, and write a cool complete 8086 emulator soon.
