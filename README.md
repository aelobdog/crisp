## Crisp

### Description
Crisp is a chip8 interpreter that I developed from scratch using C and SDL2.

### Motivation
I wanted to write an emulator that could display pixels on the screen, and the CHIP8 system/interpreter seemed like a simple project to work on. I loved working on this, even though SDL2 was a bit of a pain in the a** sometimes.
