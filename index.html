		<div class="content"><h2> Crisp</h2><br><h3> Description</h3>Crisp is a chip8 interpreter that I developed from scratch using C and SDL2.<br><br><h3> Motivation</h3>I wanted to write an emulator that could display pixels on the screen, and the CHIP8 system/interpreter seemed like a simple project to work on. I loved working on this, even though SDL2 was a bit of a pain in the a<strong></strong> sometimes.<br>
